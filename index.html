    <h2>Cities I've lived in</<h2>
      <p>I was born in Columbus and shortly thereafter moved to Rochester. We moved a few
      times around the city and then I went to College in Dayton. A few short moves
      after college until I ended up in Boulder.</p>

      <li>Columbus OH</li>
      <li>Rochester, NY</li>
      <li>Fairport, NY</li>
      <li>Pittsford, NY</li>

    <h2>Cities I'd like to visit</h2>
    <p>I'd really like to go to Tokyo for a visit, but the others, I could care
      less about. Just creating items for the list.</p>
